# khan-academy-SQL-challenges

The "Khan_data_dig" file that was added is my first large project from Khan Academy's SQL course, which is the Astronauts table and some queries. 
Other files include copies of the queries ranfor different challenge problems throughout Khan Academy's  Intro to SQL: Querying and managing data course.
